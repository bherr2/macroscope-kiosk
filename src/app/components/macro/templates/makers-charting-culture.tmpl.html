            <strong>Maximilian Schich</strong> is an art historian and multidisciplinary scientist who aims to understand the nature of culture by integrating qualitative inquiry and observation with methods of computation, natural science, and information design. Schich is an associate professor in arts & technology and a founding member of The Edith O'Donnell Institute of Art History at The University of Texas at Dallas. He holds a PhD in art history from Humboldt-University in Berlin and a MA in Art History, classical archaeology, and psychology from Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. His extensive consulting experience with cultural graph data set the base for a five year post-doc phase dealing with Complex Networks in Art Research, while in residence at Max-Planck in Rome, BarabásiLab at Northeastern University in Boston, and Dirk Helbing's group at ETH Zurich. Schich is the organizing chair of the NetSci symposia on Arts, Humanities, and Complex Networks, an editorial advisor at the journal <em>Leonardo</em>, and an editorial board member at Palgrave Communications. He publishes in multiple disciplines and is a prolific speaker, translating his ideas to diverse audiences in academia and the industry.
