The Earth visualization maps real-time data onto the surface of a globe, so anyone can explore conditions anywhere on Earth. SPIN the globe to pick a location.

        'learn': 'Whether we like it or complain about it, bask in it or suffer from it, we all are affected by the weather. This essential truth becomes readily apparent when viewing Earth, the work of software engineer Cameron Beccario. Using data from the Global Forecast System, Earth visualizes worldwide weather patterns using animated wind streams, color coded according to velocity, that sweep across a three-dimensional globe. Truly interactive, the visualization allows the user to spin the globe and zoom in on a desired location. Tapping on that location will then bring up further information about exact coordinates, wind speed, and temperature, with all information updated every three hours. The world itself may be seen from different perspectives, as the visualization offers nine different projections, such as conic equidistant, stereographic, or Waterman Butterfly. When Earth was first introduced in December 2013, it only visualized wind patterns. Since then, however, Beccario has increased the number of overlays to include such factors as carbon monoxide concentration, dust and sulfate extinction, along with the measured temperature. Earth also shows the perceived temperature which Beccario calls the Misery Index, borrowing a term from economics. Explore the full functionality at http://earth.nullschool.net.',

How would that change the way we understand global issues and priorities? This visualization shows how geographic communities are created through connections made within the news media. To get started:  SPIN the globe and SELECT a country  OBSERVE how often those countries are mentioned together  SEARCH for unexpected connections between countries',
        'learn': 'This macroscope created by Kalev H. Leetaru, an expert on big data and global society, uses as its source material, quite literally, the news of the world. The visualization explores how the world’s news media groups countries into distinct clusters, creating an inherent geographic network structure over the planet akin to “communities” as seen through the eyes of the world’s presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in the world, it compiles a list of all other countries also mentioned in those articles. It is important to note that this is not how often coverage from a country mentions other countries; it is how often coverage from any country in the world that is about that country mentions other countries. In other words, it is about context. Countries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic proximity, but also economic and political ties, joint involvement in a major international event or narrative, or contextualization. Here, blue incoming lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the source country also mentioned the selected country. Red outgoing lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mentioned the destination country. The size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate the percentage of co-occurring mentions. In a given week, nearly every country is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest co-occurrence relationships.

By using this discovery tool, viewers may browse reports by topic and subtopic, see the relatedness of reports via elaborate networks of book covers dynamically displayed on the screen, and access detailed information about individual reports. The version of AcademyScopepresented here consists of two main interfaces. The Topic View provides a proportional depiction of the number of titles within each sub-topic network. Sub-topic globes display relative publishing activity within individual sub-topics. The Sub-Topic View displays a network representation of the relationship between Academies reports based on full-text lexical analysis of each publication. This allows the user to highlight any given title and its related publications and also to view the number of titles published in that sub-topic by year. According to its creators, AcademyScope was designed and programmed to be fun, informative, and easy to use. Thus, it proves both inviting to experts in a given field and to the layperson who wishes to become better informed about a particular subject.',

In just five minutes, the animation covers 2,600 years of human history, from 600 BCE to 2012 CE, by tracking 120,000 individuals important enough in their day that their birth and death locations were recorded. The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis. Birthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of death, denoted by red dots. At first, these arcs are rather limited. However, with increases in transportation technology, the arcs span greater and greater geographical distances. In addition, the animation reveals how increased concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth, and how America’s west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains with promises of a new life.
