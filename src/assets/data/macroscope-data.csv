When scientists talk about climate change they use words like observations, models, and temperature anomalies. Are we talking past each other when it comes to climate change? Or do we share a common language?</p>
<p><em>The Climate Tweetoscope</em>, developed by David Chavalarias and Maziyar Panahi, illustrates areas of divergence and overlap in the climate change conversation. Explore more than 30,000 scientific articles analyzed over 30 years with the Science view. The larger the topic, the more often it is used. Compare this to the Twitter & Media view, which analyzes more than 47 million tweets posted from January of 2018 through April of 2018. Green topics get balanced attention from scientists and from the public, whereas red topics are primarily discussed in research and blue topics are mostly addressed on Twitter. Using the companion website (climate.iscpif.fr) you can simultaneously query a database of 300,000 papers and more than 100 million tweets.</p>","This network contains over 47 million tweets and 27,000 papers. Compare the two to see how public interests and scientific research papers overlap when it comes to climate change."

Composed of over 130,000 data points pulled from Google Trends, the ebb and flow of the past 12 years of food trends are revealed. Some insights are predictable. Searches for turkey peak in November around Thanksgiving and chocolate has a spike in February near Valentine's Day. Other patterns reveal changes in our collective diet as people turn their attention (and stomachs) to cauliflower and cronuts. The <em>Rhythm of Food</em> is a collaboration between Google News Lab and Truth & Beauty.</p>",Can Google search terms shed light on changing food trends?

They found that the most influential work of a scientist's career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. The team coined this the random impact rule. This visualization shows the random impact rule in all its power.
