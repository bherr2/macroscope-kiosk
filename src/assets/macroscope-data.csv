When scientists talk about climate change they use words like observations, models, and temperature anomalies. Are we talking past each other when it comes to climate change? Or do we share a common language?
The Climate Tweetoscope, developed by David Chavalarias and Maziyar Panahi, illustrates areas of divergence and overlap in the climate change conversation. Explore more than 30,000 scientific articles analyzed over 30 years with the Science view. The larger the topic, the more often it is used. Compare this to the Twitter & Media view, which analyzes more than 47million tweets posted from January of 2018 through April of 2018. Green topics get balanced attention from scientists and from the public, whereas red topics are primarily discussed in research and blue topics are mostly addressed on Twitter. Using the companion website (climate.iscpif.fr) you can simultaneously query a database of 300k papers and more than 100M tweets.","This network contains over 47million tweets and 27,000 papers. Compare the two to see howpublic interests and scientific research papers overlap when it comes to climate change."

That is, the highest-impact workhas the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last.

The visualization explores how news stories group countries into distinct clusters, creating ageographic network over the planet,visualizing“communities” as seen through the eyes of the world’s presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in the world, it compiles a list of other countries also mentioned in those articles.
It is important to note that it is not how often coverage from acountry mentions other countries; it is how often coverage mentions two countries in the same article. In other words, it is about context.
Countries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic proximity, but also economic and political ties, orjoint involvement in a major international event. Blue incoming lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mention the destination country.
The size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate how often two countries are connected in the news. In a given week, nearly every country is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest connections.","Connections are drawn between countries based on the news: online, television, print, and radio in over 65 different languages.
